## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Express.js application up and running in a Docker container.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your machine.

### Step 1: Install Docker Desktop

Download and install Docker Desktop from the official website for your operating system (Windows in your case). Once installed, make sure the Docker Desktop application is running.

### Step 2: Create a New Directory for Your Express.js Project

Create a new folder on your computer where you want to keep your Express.js project. You can do this using the file explorer or the command line.

For example, to create a folder called "express-app", open the Command Prompt or PowerShell (Windows Terminal) and navigate to the desired location where you want to create the folder:

```bash
cd C:\path\to\your\projects
mkdir express-app
cd express-app
